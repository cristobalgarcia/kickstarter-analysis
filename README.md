# kickstarter-analysis
Performing analysis on Kickstarter data to uncover trends

## Overview of Project
Data and analysis that provides an overview of campaigns with success and fail ratios with dollar amounts

### Purpose
Use the data to see what trends bring more positive outcomes to campaigns

## Analysis and Challenges
To specify seperate industries, we analyzed outcomes based on launch date for theater and outcome based on goals for plays

### Analysis of Outcomes Based on Launch Date

The data on the chart signals that theater success for campaigns was on May. The failed line almost follows the directions as to where the success line is going. 

### Analysis of Outcomes Based on Goals

For plays category, goals set for $0 - $4999 and $35000 - $44999 had better success rate to reach campaign goals. More than $45,000 meant lower chances to meet the goal. 

### Challenges and Difficulties Encountered
The data provided is only enough to get a general overview as to what is happening behind curtains. 

## Results

- Theater outcomes by Date gives us that May and mainly summer months provide the best time to launch a campaign. On the other hand, December is the worst time to launch a campaign. 

- Outcomes bases on goals has that goals for more than $45,000 are difficult to reach. Before $45,000, the success rate goes up and down. 

- Although the data used is good, it still does not give a complete picture in regards to how much money was given per donor. Another factor that can provide accurate analysis is how the campaigns were marketed. 

- Some tables and charts that can be used for the data include a pivot table that related directly to the country as each country is usually different per trends. A scatter plot can provide any outliers that can provide results with more concentrated areas.
